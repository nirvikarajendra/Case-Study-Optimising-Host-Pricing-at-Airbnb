## Case Study: Optimizing Host Pricing at Airbnb

- This project analyzes Airbnb’s challenge of optimizing host pricing using data-driven methods. By applying Decision Tree modeling, the study aims to predict optimal listing prices based on key factors such as location, amenities, reviews, and seasonality balancing host profitability, customer satisfaction, and model interpretability.

- The project integrates Lean Six Sigma principles to ensure scientific rigor, efficiency, and continuous improvement across all stages from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and deployment. Decision Trees were chosen for their transparency, scalability, and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relationships in pricing data.

Overall, this case study demonstrates how effective data science leadership can drive innovation in the hospitality industry, enabling Airbnb to make informed, adaptable, and ethical decisions in dynamic market environments.
